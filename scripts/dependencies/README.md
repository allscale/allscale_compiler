# AllScale Environment Setup

This dependency installer is based on Insieme's dependency installer.
For detailed information see `/insieme/scripts/dependencies/README.md`.

You have the ability to specify packages here which take precedence.
If a package is not found here, the installer will try to find it inside Insieme's dependency installer.
Note that the defaults set in this directory are used even with the packages located inside Insieme.
